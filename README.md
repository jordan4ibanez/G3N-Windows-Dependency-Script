# G3N-Win64-Dependency-Script
 This is a simple script I created so Windows users do not have to fuss about with installing G3N and they can install it as easily as on Linux.

This is designed to be run-in-place, as in you set it somewhere you don't find gets in the way, run the script, and never look at it again until there's a major update.

I recommend \My Documents\

Required software:

It is highly recommended you use the default install locations unless you want to rewrite part of the script for your specific Windows environment.

## Issue/Solution:

### VSCODE:

    $ the term 'gcc' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet

This is very simple, if you run gcc in command prompt, you will notice it works there. What you have to do is restart vscode, then close the open powershell terminals and open a new one to reload the environment.
